BurgerKing,its the old tendercrisp that was used before the newer one http://chickensandwich.blogspot.com/2007/12/firecracker-tendercrisp-from-burger.html
BurgerKing,"Yea, they can get pretty huffy about that stuff.  Probably because a lot of ppl try to scam.  Not the best customer service but I understand where it comes from.  I was able to get the banner to work eventually, had to keep opening/trying/closing the app to get it to work though.  Hey, might work you."
BurgerKing,"Yes BK delivers , please give all praise and glory to God for this"
BurgerKing,"I did too and it didn't work at all. I told the lady at Burger King and she was pretty rude about it, but she put something in and gave it to me anyway. I was like, ""well it isn't my fault the app isn't working."""
McDonalds,"I have actually been to this McDonald‚Äôs.  We went in the plane to check it out, but ate inside the restaurant."
BurgerKing,Same problem here.  Can't click the banner to redeem.  Tried updating and reinstalling...
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up

McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.
BurgerKing,"Seems that way.

BurgerKing,Is it back?!
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"This reminds me, what happened to the buttermilk chicken tenders?"
BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,You can give them to homeless people..
McDonalds,why you going to mcdonalds if you wanna eat healthy food
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I was told 3 weeks ago it was gone
McDonalds,Let people eat what they want. And font be jealous McDs is as big and popular as they are.
BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."
BurgerKing,you had me for the first 2 paragraphs lol
BurgerKing,Really? You can't guess why you got fired?
BurgerKing,You might need to work on your verbal judo a bit...

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"
McDonalds,You are not wrong.
McDonalds,"Yeah, I saw The Founder on Netflix. I feel bad for the Mcdonald‚Äôs brothers."

I'm actually the 5 night closing manager and I'm about to start college for comp sci that's why I'm curious and may eventually want to work for sicom/xenial. 

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."
BurgerKing,The cheese pull? lol.
BurgerKing,Ew

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.

BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"Yea, they can get pretty huffy about that stuff.  Probably because a lot of ppl try to scam.  Not the best customer service but I understand where it comes from.  I was able to get the banner to work eventually, had to keep opening/trying/closing the app to get it to work though.  Hey, might work you."
BurgerKing,"Yes BK delivers , please give all praise and glory to God for this"
BurgerKing,"I did too and it didn't work at all. I told the lady at Burger King and she was pretty rude about it, but she put something in and gave it to me anyway. I was like, ""well it isn't my fault the app isn't working."""
McDonalds,"I have actually been to this McDonald‚Äôs.  We went in the plane to check it out, but ate inside the restaurant."
BurgerKing,Same problem here.  Can't click the banner to redeem.  Tried updating and reinstalling...
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.

BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along
BurgerKing,Garbage

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.

BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.

BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"

BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Sorry I didn't know you were autistic. Try the chicken fries, lots of incels/autismo like those too."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yes BK delivers , please give all praise and glory to God for this"
BurgerKing,"I did too and it didn't work at all. I told the lady at Burger King and she was pretty rude about it, but she put something in and gave it to me anyway. I was like, ""well it isn't my fault the app isn't working."""
McDonalds,"I have actually been to this McDonald‚Äôs.  We went in the plane to check it out, but ate inside the restaurant."
BurgerKing,Same problem here.  Can't click the banner to redeem.  Tried updating and reinstalling...
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along
BurgerKing,Garbage

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.
BurgerKing,"Seems that way.

BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.

BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."

BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."
BurgerKing,The cheese pull? lol.
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Keep me updated please!
BurgerKing,"Sounds interesting, I'll have to try that one next time I work. I've found a few from employees ringing up coupons"
McDonalds,Couldn‚Äôt access on mobile. Do you have a direct pdf link?

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(
McDonalds,"From the posting rules in this sub's sidebar:

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."

BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.

BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."

BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I did too and it didn't work at all. I told the lady at Burger King and she was pretty rude about it, but she put something in and gave it to me anyway. I was like, ""well it isn't my fault the app isn't working."""
McDonalds,"I have actually been to this McDonald‚Äôs.  We went in the plane to check it out, but ate inside the restaurant."

McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."

McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.

McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."
BurgerKing,you had me for the first 2 paragraphs lol
BurgerKing,Really? You can't guess why you got fired?

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"
McDonalds,You are not wrong.
McDonalds,"Yeah, I saw The Founder on Netflix. I feel bad for the Mcdonald‚Äôs brothers."
McDonalds,"same in many europen countrys, and in others such as Singapore and Malaysia its fully owned by a Saudi group."

I'm actually the 5 night closing manager and I'm about to start college for comp sci that's why I'm curious and may eventually want to work for sicom/xenial. 

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."
BurgerKing,The cheese pull? lol.
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Keep me updated please!

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?

I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."

BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."

McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
McDonalds,"I have actually been to this McDonald‚Äôs.  We went in the plane to check it out, but ate inside the restaurant."
BurgerKing,Same problem here.  Can't click the banner to redeem.  Tried updating and reinstalling...
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along
BurgerKing,Garbage

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.
BurgerKing,"Seems that way.

McDonalds,"This reminds me, what happened to the buttermilk chicken tenders?"
BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I was told 3 weeks ago it was gone
McDonalds,Let people eat what they want. And font be jealous McDs is as big and popular as they are.
BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."

BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"

McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."

BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"

BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ

BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."

BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.

BurgerKing,"Sorry I didn't know you were autistic. Try the chicken fries, lots of incels/autismo like those too."

BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting

BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,Same problem here.  Can't click the banner to redeem.  Tried updating and reinstalling...
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.

McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent

BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"

McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"

BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."

McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."

BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."

McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby.

McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(
McDonalds,"From the posting rules in this sub's sidebar:

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]

BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."

BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!

BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,Can‚Äôt wait to get my 2 for $6
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç

BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby

McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?

BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.

McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."

BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."
BurgerKing,you had me for the first 2 paragraphs lol
BurgerKing,Really? You can't guess why you got fired?
BurgerKing,You might need to work on your verbal judo a bit...

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"
McDonalds,You are not wrong.
McDonalds,"Yeah, I saw The Founder on Netflix. I feel bad for the Mcdonald‚Äôs brothers."
McDonalds,"same in many europen countrys, and in others such as Singapore and Malaysia its fully owned by a Saudi group."

BurgerKing,"Thanks for the info!! 

I'm actually the 5 night closing manager and I'm about to start college for comp sci that's why I'm curious and may eventually want to work for sicom/xenial. 

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."

BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."

BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."

McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"

I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,the $1 spicey?
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place

BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.
BurgerKing,"Seems that way.

McDonalds,"This reminds me, what happened to the buttermilk chicken tenders?"
BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

McDonalds,You can give them to homeless people..
McDonalds,why you going to mcdonalds if you wanna eat healthy food
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I was told 3 weeks ago it was gone
McDonalds,Let people eat what they want. And font be jealous McDs is as big and popular as they are.
BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"

BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ

BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity

BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,Dont work there no more and wasn‚Äôt the Gm so i wasn‚Äôt wasting my time but to add to that all the burger kings in my area were like that and  they fired my Gm after i left and that store is this the same sooooo  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BurgerKing,What was it
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along
BurgerKing,Garbage

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.

McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,I was told 3 weeks ago it was gone

BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.

BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.

The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(
McDonalds,"From the posting rules in this sub's sidebar:

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Sorry I didn't know you were autistic. Try the chicken fries, lots of incels/autismo like those too."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,Dont work there no more and wasn‚Äôt the Gm so i wasn‚Äôt wasting my time but to add to that all the burger kings in my area were like that and  they fired my Gm after i left and that store is this the same sooooo  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BurgerKing,"Wow that‚Äôs ridiculous, one of my shift supervisors would go on smoke breaks like every 30 minutes and stay out there for like 10 minutes"
BurgerKing, üòéüëç
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?

McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.

BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along
BurgerKing,Garbage

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.

BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8

BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"
McDonalds,You are not wrong.
McDonalds,"Yeah, I saw The Founder on Netflix. I feel bad for the Mcdonald‚Äôs brothers."
McDonalds,"same in many europen countrys, and in others such as Singapore and Malaysia its fully owned by a Saudi group."
McDonalds,"Actually, any restaurant is family-run if the CEO has a family"
McDonalds,"In many senses a lot of restaurants, especially in Australia, are still family run."
BurgerKing," This is definitely the best burger i've ever had at Burger King, so tasty"
BurgerKing,"This is definitely the best burger i've ever had at Burger King, so tasty"
BurgerKing,They are back at my store!
BurgerKing,"Thanks for the info!! 

I'm actually the 5 night closing manager and I'm about to start college for comp sci that's why I'm curious and may eventually want to work for sicom/xenial. 

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."
BurgerKing,The cheese pull? lol.
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Keep me updated please!
BurgerKing,"Sounds interesting, I'll have to try that one next time I work. I've found a few from employees ringing up coupons"
McDonalds,Couldn‚Äôt access on mobile. Do you have a direct pdf link?

McDonalds,"the guide is in here:

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Sorry I didn't know you were autistic. Try the chicken fries, lots of incels/autismo like those too."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!

BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,Dont work there no more and wasn‚Äôt the Gm so i wasn‚Äôt wasting my time but to add to that all the burger kings in my area were like that and  they fired my Gm after i left and that store is this the same sooooo  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BurgerKing,"Wow that‚Äôs ridiculous, one of my shift supervisors would go on smoke breaks like every 30 minutes and stay out there for like 10 minutes"
BurgerKing,Omg is this Richmond?!
BurgerKing,wha
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,Me too.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,I care
McDonalds,I also don't care
McDonalds,I don't care
BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up

McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Don‚Äôt do that... Don‚Äôt give me hope.
BurgerKing,"Seems that way.

BurgerKing,Is it back?!
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"This reminds me, what happened to the buttermilk chicken tenders?"
BurgerKing,It's available in Norway.
McDonalds,Thought it was just 1 doller off large fries
BurgerKing,Our Grilled chicken was discontinued I‚Äôd say about more than 5-6 months ago. Maybe even more lol
McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"
BurgerKing,Don't fall for the bait m8
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,You can give them to homeless people..
McDonalds,why you going to mcdonalds if you wanna eat healthy food
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I was told 3 weeks ago it was gone
McDonalds,Let people eat what they want. And font be jealous McDs is as big and popular as they are.
BurgerKing,"Im sure its due to covid 19, ours ran out of fries, ice cream and milk."
BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

OP goes to his happy place and begins to form a story of how he fought a covid denier."
McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."
McDonalds,Mike Chen AKA Strictly Dumpling
McDonalds,No problem? Have you seen your death rates?
BurgerKing,Then you met the manager out back and start making out while giving each other handies.
BurgerKing,Most fake story I've ever read. Maybe next time try /r/twosentencehorror
BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."
BurgerKing,Honestly you seem like a really boring as person if you sit around fantasizing about dumb stories to tell.
BurgerKing,"I guess OP likes writing ""I got in a fight"" fanfics about themselves? Odd post history."
BurgerKing,you had me for the first 2 paragraphs lol
BurgerKing,Really? You can't guess why you got fired?
BurgerKing,You might need to work on your verbal judo a bit...

BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true! I just came back from Burger King and was told the same thing, discontinued! So pissed!"
BurgerKing,Was just at foxon rd in New haven ct and was told they would no longer be selling onion rings or mozz sticks
BurgerKing,I'm in Rhode Island and I can't find onion rings anywhere. Burger King and Sonic both don't have them consistently. But the stores have onions so I don't know what's going on.
BurgerKing,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it!"
McDonalds,You are not wrong.
McDonalds,"Yeah, I saw The Founder on Netflix. I feel bad for the Mcdonald‚Äôs brothers."

I'm actually the 5 night closing manager and I'm about to start college for comp sci that's why I'm curious and may eventually want to work for sicom/xenial. 

As far as I know it only tracks deletes and if you clear it and don't send it to the kitchen display, it won't show up."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.
BurgerKing,Thanks for watching!
McDonalds,"Based on how they put it up, I doubt that there is one."
McDonalds,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/business/mcdonalds-reopening-instructions-coronavirus/index.html

Sorry I thought this link was the same story I read on CNN earlier"
McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel
McDonalds,"I think I'll stick to the drive thru.  While I love McDonald's,  I don't need government propaganda spoken and ""signed"" to me throughout my meal."
BurgerKing,The cheese pull? lol.
BurgerKing,Ew

BurgerKing,My local BK doesn't do burritos... It's either egg or fish in buns. The only franchise that does burritos are McDonald's and KFC... TTnTT
BurgerKing,"If your local BK does breakfast, they‚Äôll have the burritos. They should have all the ingredients to make this..."
BurgerKing,Fuck... I wish I'm american. That looks so good....
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"
McDonalds,Sydney airport i think
BurgerKing,Oh thank God! I damn near cried when I saw they were discontinued. üòÜ
McDonalds,like the ones where everyone else touches or breathes on your food first
BurgerKing,I was always on the broiler/sandwich station.
McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"

BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.

BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,Dont work there no more and wasn‚Äôt the Gm so i wasn‚Äôt wasting my time but to add to that all the burger kings in my area were like that and  they fired my Gm after i left and that store is this the same sooooo  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BurgerKing,"Wow that‚Äôs ridiculous, one of my shift supervisors would go on smoke breaks like every 30 minutes and stay out there for like 10 minutes"
BurgerKing,Omg is this Richmond?!
BurgerKing,Surprisingly no. However they did leave this one underage girl in charge of the store for hours at a time because the store manager hated being there so she dipped whenever she got the chance.
BurgerKing,SEX?!?!!!
McDonalds,It‚Äôs def not as shiny as it looks in the pictures. It‚Äôs like the corner of the old playgrounds as a kid. Staff rarely venture out there to wipe it down.
BurgerKing,ü§¢
BurgerKing,[removed]
McDonalds,Awesome thanks for the link
BurgerKing,"Especially when I had the firecracker one. This is the only thing I would get at BK one I tried it. I never understood why most people don't like it. I know the new one is supposed to be better quality, but I have no idea why this one tasted so good too me."
McDonalds,See /r/McLounge and/or /r/mcdonaldsemployees
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve eaten here multiple times. Super cosy, but hardly anyone eats in it? Which is surprising, I‚Äôd assume it would be like... always full"
BurgerKing,Who cares
McDonalds,"We don't have the staff, so we discontinued a few items temporary"
McDonalds,We have no room behind the counter to move the fountain machine.  We are so low in staff that I don't know how we could do it in the lobby
BurgerKing,"It's not tho, they definitely taste different, and not like Coke and Pepsi."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,"in Barstow, California it is a decommissioned train"
McDonalds,"Okay, you may have a point, but it does come to a time where it becomes unreasonable to serve that many customers as it overwhelms the store. As it‚Äôs shown, that line is unreasonable for any business to be able to function at a decent pace. It shouldn‚Äôt get to the point of almost blocking major roads with traffic."
McDonalds,"Me too! I always make the effort to try the local McDonalds. I stumbled across [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) which shows different McDonalds around the world, I thought it was very interesting"
McDonalds,Late to the party but [Mcnomz](https://www.instagram.com/mcnomz/) shows other interesting things you can eat at McDonald‚Äôs around the world
McDonalds,that‚Äôs pretty cool
BurgerKing,Not to scare you but Watch out for wage theft. Make sure you check your pay stub to see the deductions. Franchise owners are almost always out to get a buck haha.
BurgerKing,"It might be possible for someone to use the code without leaving a comment in the thread.

We need to crack down on that"
McDonalds,"Then the store needs to limit the orders.  It‚Äôs called a lineup.  Example, 10,000 people go to a concert and they all want to get in at one time but they can‚Äôt because it would overwhelm and cause chaos.

So they line up and just process what they can, they don‚Äôt cancel the concert.

You realize the point of a business is to be busy and make money right?"
BurgerKing,"The app won‚Äôt even allow me to click on the banner, yet every other banner in the app works. What a POS app lol"
BurgerKing,"Use drive thru, tell them you have a t mobile Tuesday coupon for a free Impossible Whopper, they‚Äôll ask the code, so far it‚Äôs always been M G R R E Q. Maybe someone can confirm it this time?"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Does anyone know if this applies to Sprint customers too? I got a message a few days ago telling me Sprint and T-Mobile merged and now I can talk and use data at the same time.
BurgerKing,"I have prepaid T-Mobile service so I can‚Äôt redeem any of the T-Mobile Tuesdays offers, but have you tried redeeming on the website on your computer? Sometimes the mobile apps give me problems on my iPad or Samsung phone though the website works once in a while better.  Just a suggestion."
BurgerKing,Thank you
BurgerKing,I want to suck on your big nipples
BurgerKing,Just order a whopper without meat patty and add onion rings
BurgerKing,I'm LOVEING IT
BurgerKing,LOVE IT
BurgerKing,This burher is fucking amazing
BurgerKing,"It does have a code, yeah. I did find a way to make it work!

So for anyone who encounters this issue, I opened the email in my computer's browser. Open it from your email app on your phone and it'll sign you in immediately. That's probably how it's supposed to work, but many times, I can sign in or say OK on something on my computer that'll sign me into an app on my phone and vice versa. I guess it doesn't work for BK, but it's an easy solution, thankfully!"
BurgerKing,"Does the image have a code or any identification for a coupon code? The times that I've given out that deal I've always just been shown that image and I just show it to my manager and they will probably accept it. I'm not sure if it actually gives you something in the app so you can for instance make a mobile order with it. I would recommend just walking in and showing the person working up from the image and asking if they can accept it.

Sorry that's been my experience."
McDonalds,"Idk man, I‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 uber eats orders lined up in my line on top of the 5 door dash orders and the 3 post mates, and 3 grub hub. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least"
McDonalds,"There‚Äôs always gonna be people who want Mcdonalds, but when people overload a store with delivery orders like they did for this store apparently, it‚Äôs gonna cause chaos"
McDonalds,You totally can. You could also just ask for a medium with extra ice. As an employee that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done a couple times
BurgerKing,"I started working in February and on the first day BK opened in my town. It was definitely a rough start since not many people had experience, though some people transformed over. I became one of the better employees i belive, not trying to brag I'm just basing it off hours given, I was given 4 or 5 days a week. I was a junior in HS during this taking all advance classes. The workload from school and work became too much to bare and I ended up lowering my hours till the end of school.

Well all the Corona buisness caused school to shut down so I'm back to working 6-9 hour shifts 4 days a week. 

Its definitely not the best job and I'm pretty tired most of the time. But this is my first job and its given pretty good work experience so far."
BurgerKing,"Today actually I found a secret code. I dont remember what the code was, but it was a 100 nuggets for 10 dollars. I want to figure out more codes"
BurgerKing,I feel like the way they treat their employees along with the weak base pay with no sick days this will be the end product. Always happened to me at night.  Sloppy mcsloperson ALL THE WAY!!!
BurgerKing,"Lol it‚Äôs a throwaway account because I didn‚Äôt want this post linked to my regular account. I worked at bk when I was a sophomore in high school though. I used to loveeeee their ranch.

I‚Äôm 28 now and tried it again for the first time in forever and one little ranch cup is just not enough.

Sadly, no one sold me a box. Oh well. Life goes on."
BurgerKing,Sounds like someone at BK corporate is fishing for some bad employees. Account is too new with no activity. Makes me question the authenticity.
McDonalds,"So...because it‚Äôs really popular you think it should be be stopped?  I mean, why not just longer wait times or something.  I don‚Äôt get this."
BurgerKing,For me?
BurgerKing,?
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's pretty cool
BurgerKing,Depends on your area but as said from others it is third party basically. I live in a moderately populated college town but delivery is a no go.
BurgerKing,Haha
BurgerKing,both have been around for a few months
BurgerKing,\*with bacon*
BurgerKing,Agreed. Now I just use them as big sandwich toppings.
BurgerKing,This came out ages ago lmao its not really new
BurgerKing,You said. 75% of ppl are normal. Then there's the 25% scum/borderline. They breed. And have shiitty children. Cycle goes on. I'm a Dad and just like my Dad I teach respect and kindness . And Check your ego always.
BurgerKing,Uk no delivery
BurgerKing,"Or a Salad Burger!?

https://www.burgerking.co.nz/menu-item/salad-burger"
BurgerKing,"I love being home. Extra pickles in side, olives, 8 hot sauces to choose from, mayo and malt vinegar on fries. Mmmmmmmm. C'mon you wanna be home stuffin your face"
BurgerKing,Nasty or pointless? I'd rather a falafel patty
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,The BK app offers delivery through I think door dash or Uber eats. And our menu is also available via post mates. Delivery charges may apply but earlier our app was offering free delivery over a certain $ amount. Good luck.
BurgerKing,Bk the company/restaurant doesn't deliver. You have to use a 3rd party like door dash. I've took countless calls asking if folks can place an order for delivery. I have to explain delivery orders must be made thru door dash. (No uber eats in my area)
BurgerKing,Every time I open the BK app it asks me pickup or delivery.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,They‚Äôre pushing it harder than ever now. Yes.
McDonalds,Weebs have no power in America.
McDonalds,No surprises for the government. I work at McDonald's and we knew they were closing 2 days ahead as they were in talks with government prior to the 23rd announcement.
BurgerKing,Right
BurgerKing,"I really cant believe bacon cheesy tots were mentioned... like the original cheesy tots were good and well liked but the bacon cheesy tots??? Holy man they tasted ass and did not sell as well.

I do have to mention the original firecracker sauce that was used on the spicy chicken jrs. Was actually hot and was amazing. Still miss it to this day."
BurgerKing,B
BurgerKing,I didn't have to look at an account history
BurgerKing,"Yeah some of my funniest life stories came from Burger King, and I'm sure yours will too. It seems so confusing at first but after a few weeks you get the hang of things :)"
BurgerKing,Okay
BurgerKing,"That's hilarious and horrible at the same time, I'm excited to get more used to the job, so far I'm liking"
BurgerKing,"On my first day I made way worse mistakes trust me, even my first few weeks. On my third day I accidentally gave out a 120 dollar order without taking the money and they drove off so trust me it does get better. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)"
BurgerKing,Thanks
BurgerKing,Please don‚Äôt.
BurgerKing,"Canada always seems to get the good stuff, they got the garlic burger as well"
BurgerKing,Just looking at your account history it's clear you're a flat out dumbass or a troll.
BurgerKing,LEARN TO TALK CLEARLY OR JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY YOU STUPID FOOL
BurgerKing,"The question is :

in my area, only kebab is served

Thousands of foods are missing

What is better between :

[ Option A, current model ] building 999 restaurants in my area

[ Option B, new model ] building 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food&amp;chef ) in my area

What is better ?

You say either A or B"
BurgerKing,"Learn to cook yourself or order delivery. 

""Thousands of foods"" ??? yeah sure, moron. You're barely even able to write a coherent thought. Bye now."
BurgerKing,"I am an idiot and you are smart, I know

This is why I am asking you

in my area, only kebab is served, thousands of foods are missing

How do you solve this ?"
BurgerKing,The only situation going on with you is that you're a clueless idiot
BurgerKing,"Let me tell you my situation,

( My situation is similar to a lot of people's situation )

When I go outside,
I have to walk for 12 minutes, then I find a restaurant, it is a kebab restaurant,

Do you see ?

in my area, only kebab is served

in my area, people can eat almost nothing

Do you see why eating out is difficult ?

Do you see why something is wrong ?

Like I said, a lot of people are in a similar situation

in my area, thousands of foods are missing

in my area, should we apply the current model and build 999 restaurants ?

or, should we apply the new model and build 1 eating-spot ( restaurant with rotating food &amp; chef ) ?"
BurgerKing,"That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You have no idea how a restaurant/ kitchen operates, do you?"
McDonalds,Why is this only a thing in Japan :C
BurgerKing," Your gonna need to be more specific. But I handle them like I would any other stranger. I'm polite, respectful and i genuinely care about folks."
BurgerKing,"Unrelated question, how do you deal with customers?"
BurgerKing,15 years. And counting. It does help my store is a 3 minute walk from my house.
BurgerKing,"Yep, unfortunately"
BurgerKing,that‚Äôs dedication! are you a manager?
BurgerKing,Like 8 years
BurgerKing,"Lasted about 6 months. Quit a few days ago. Some of the workers and 3/4 of the management were insufferable. Also way too many hours that almost cost me my graduation and an unwillingness to negotiate. And just so many other small things. An unclean store (like seriously, it was so bad that corporate got involved on multiple occasions), constant complaining from some employees, other people not doing their job right, etc."
BurgerKing,Homes of the Whopper
BurgerKing, 3 years. 6 different stores üòÖ
BurgerKing,"You should go for it! Now during a pandemic its hard to find jobs. Besides, great experience and opportunities for promotion!

During my relative short time in BK I managed to climb from the bottom to manager."
BurgerKing,"damn i only lasted 5 months, they offered me my job back but idk yet"
BurgerKing,1 and a half year. Someone get me out of here.
BurgerKing,"yeah, they used to call them ""CBTs"" for ""computer-based tutorials"" but there was less video"
BurgerKing,Dont worry about it you'll learn as you work. We all went through that it gets better
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,It was eights hours of training then today I'm doing the register and working with the manager(I'm on break rn)
BurgerKing,CBTs? It's like a BK website where you watch videos and occasionally do test and virtual things
McDonalds,IüòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èsome McDonald‚Äôs.
BurgerKing,"straight up videos or are they still using ""CBTs""?"
McDonalds,"This is misleading. 

If you have X amount of Uber drivers waiting for food, they have an algorithm that stops any more order being placed. This is to help with social distancing for the drivers."
BurgerKing,"I didn‚Äôt have any training at all, they just told me to watch them while they did the drive through and then handed it off to me while they where next to me Incase I needed help, and then a day later after I got the hang of it They told me how to do other stuff, pretty hands on. (I started this month)"
BurgerKing,Yea they showed me how to wrap its actually one of the easiest things the hardest part is just remembering what sandwiches have what on them but you‚Äôll learn it fast it just takes practice. It‚Äôs fine to make mistakes just ask questions when you need help with something. I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it actually is it‚Äôs mainly just about repetition and getting comfortable doing everything so it‚Äôll come second nature and you‚Äôll get fast at it :)
BurgerKing,"Do you know how to wrap yet, I feel like I'm going to mess up so much. Thanks for that though, it made me feel more at ease"
BurgerKing,"Just started 2 days ago, my first day right when I got there I started getting shown how to make the food and whatnot I was never even shown videos lol. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll start doing work soon, and it‚Äôs normal to not remember it all don‚Äôt worry about that."
BurgerKing,"I literally just sat on a tablet watching those like training videos, they are really boring and I'm probably going to forget some of the things that were on the videos, and my back was hurting too. I guess I was actually expecting to do something today, but luckily I'm doing more tomorrow"
BurgerKing,Can you share what was awful about it? Just curious.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,They need to stop the endless discounts
McDonalds,This is why McDonalds should not be open for delivery. Just Drive thru.
BurgerKing,"Wow! Uh-uh no way, off with the King's head I say. Jack wouldn't do that to you, or Miss Wendy or even that creepy clown guy.. That is SO wrong"
McDonalds,Also unable to make a profit.
McDonalds,Australia has never had free refills or public fountains and the SuperSize was phased out in about 1997 without public outcry.
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Rip
BurgerKing,"I'm glad I never woke up one day in my life and somehow believed I was entitled to all the day to day realities like roads leading everywhere, and police protection, and drinking water that doesn't kill me..."
McDonalds,"Our store just now started this last week. We are in a very small town. Making breakfast all day is annoying. But, I have gotten to know my customers and some of them are heart broken that we don't have it and that makes me sad."
McDonalds,the US would have revolted
BurgerKing,The government always takes more than you expect.
McDonalds,Yup. At least with the second wave I'll get another two months of boredom indoors..... got to make the most of this reopening.
McDonalds,I mean after the inevitable second peak I'm sure we will do this all over again.
McDonalds,"I'm looking forward to going back, but I think we will close again within a week. Ours is based on a really busy road with a roundabout and we can't have cars stacking up and blocking the traffic."
McDonalds,and honestly all the major outbreaks of covid you hear about are either in grocery stores of big factory like settings like meat packing plants or large mail sorting facilities. not fast food or take out restaurants
BurgerKing,"Your pay stub should show all the deductions, of you bought shows thru the store then it‚Äôll be taken out of there as well"
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,I see the Texas Double Whopper ad in the background. What part of Texas is this? I am hoping it is just a store that didn't get a large supply from their last truck order. I really hope Burger King does not end up like Wendy's.
BurgerKing,Onion rings without zesty sauce is like Destiny‚Äôs Child without Beyonc√©.
BurgerKing,"I like this. Totally will start using it. 

Found out today we are soft opening tomorrow instead of on Monday. We are NOT prepared. Plexiglass is not installed and I‚Äôve been on the verge of a panic attack all day and it‚Äôs my day off. 

Hopefully with it being a holiday weekend it will be slow. My GM thinks it will be. I dunno with people not being able to travel as much as they would on a normal situation. It will be hit or miss. My hope is people stay home and BBQ."
BurgerKing,"&gt;The ones offended that we have to wear masks

You described the demographic right there. I call them SAMs, or Simplistic Angry Males. Anyone who was in denial regarding coronavirus in March is an ultimate SAM. They are human versions of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Tiny fragments of brain matter floating around in the skull. 

Since they were in denial in the first place they aren't going to let go of that two months later or 10 years later. This is the type who will insist this never happened, that it was all an elaborate hoax. They will continue to mentally bump into every available wall and SAM their way through life.

I enjoy laughing at them. They can't debate 5 seconds minus profanity. Then they predictably run away like classic SAM I Am.

Plenty of SAManthas out there also. Sometimes the SAMantha is already well warped and sometimes they are molded into shape by their SAM."
BurgerKing,"I'll take a Big King XL small combo, hold the onions, with orange Fanta for the drink and onion rings instead of fries. Hold on, let me read this sign...OK, I'm good. I'll also take a 8-piece nuggets with ranch."
McDonalds,glad I work in a town centre store
McDonalds,Tell them you have a coupon at the earliest point. The person on the speaker puts the order into the till and there are different methods for coupons and offers to standard orders
McDonalds,"That‚Äôs helpful to know. 
I want to help keep things moving, while visiting the drive thru."
McDonalds,"At least in the US, the stores always ask you to tell them when you're ordering if you have a coupon.

Often there's a sign somewhere near the speaker."
BurgerKing,"I had their spicy nuggets today. I actually went at 10am because I skipped breakfast and since it wasn‚Äôt lunch time yet they made the nuggets fresh.

They were actually really good. I think their nuggets suck because they make a big batch and they sit until sold out, so you are always eating old stale nuggets. Ask them to make a fresh batch for you, I would say they are as good, maybe even just slightly better, then Wendy‚Äôs."
McDonalds,"Unrelated question:
When ordering in the drive-thru with a buy one get one coupon for a Big Mac. Should I just order 2 Big Mac sandwiches and tell the cashier in the window I have a BoGo coupon for them.
Or tell the order taker via the speaker I have a coupon for BOGO Big Macs, and leave it at that?"
McDonalds,"Amazing how different the responses have been in different parts of the world. McDonalds here (British Columbia) never closed. All drive-thru locations are open. Same goes for most fast food outlets. We implemented distancing measures early and our new cases each day are in the single digits.

I have to say, I trust McDonalds more than almost any food service company to maintain safe operations."
McDonalds,We have health laws on food. Same reason why full sugar version of cola costs more - our government wants to get rid off obesity by charging more apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
McDonalds,So I am getting famous in the future great üòÇ
McDonalds,Imagine walking into a McDonald‚Äôs and find  a young Sharon Stone behind the counter...
McDonalds,I don't care.
BurgerKing,I miss the old fries as well. Thought they were the very best.
McDonalds,I‚Äôm indifferent

BurgerKing,Wearing a mask greatly prevents you from infecting others.
BurgerKing,Ya.
BurgerKing,This is hilarious
BurgerKing,Why is this even a fucking thing.why would you want to hear stupid chomping sounds of someone else eating.pisses me right off
BurgerKing,I really hope you live in a country where you have to pay for your healthcare
BurgerKing,Ew
BurgerKing,Looks good. We don't have it here.
BurgerKing,That's true.
McDonalds,Might be for stricter countries that mandate something like that to even be allowed to open.
McDonalds,"Alaska, Hawaii both dont I'm pretty sure..but 99% of the continental US uses fresh beef for quarters."
McDonalds,"I‚Äôve worked at McDonald‚Äôs for 7 months, where did you hear that first statement from? We definitely get our quarter pounder beef from the freezer."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Had a guy today try to refuse to give us his payment in the pan. My GM was the one taking payments too. He said ‚ÄúI WILL not put my money in there you can take it like a human!‚Äù And then proceeded to berate us for our masks and gloves. 

I also finally had an emotional breakdown. I was on headset for 3 hours non stop. With every beep I felt it coming closer until finally I lost it. I started sobbing over the freestyle machine. Luckily my GM and the other cashier were there to support me. That‚Äôs the best part of this job. My whole store is female staff save 2 cashiers and one shift supervisor. We are all super close and help each other. 

I basically went to expediting until the end of my shift. 

Stopped and bought the biggest bottle of Merlot I could find and some sushi on the way home. Now watching Harley Quinn. 

Hopefully 2 days off will get me back."
BurgerKing,"Luckily I havent had too many bad customers more than the usual but yeah the busy drive through is killing me and I am dreading the dining room reopening. 

So many people grabbing the tray, like seriously. Defeats the whole damn purpose of the tray! Had another dude get huffy at me because he had difficulties getting his change from the pan and bitched right at me about the fact we use the pans. Sorry bro I just follow the rules, go complain to corporate and not an overworked and overstressed manager."
BurgerKing,"Uh, April got mentioned.."

McDonalds,"Lol I worked at a store that never had a soda fountain in the lobby at all.


(And no ABS at the drive thru, just a manual fountain there.)"
BurgerKing,They got rid of grilled chicken like 6 months ago
BurgerKing,"Door dash and uber drivers in my experience are WAY worse than customers, they think that because they aren‚Äôt eating the food they can be douchebags and it won‚Äôt effect them"
BurgerKing,Terrible camera lens for that use. Just because you have a wide angle lens doesn't mean you use it for everything. Also all the crinkling of the paper is obnoxious AF because your microphone pics up everything. Do better
McDonalds,"Seriously, chill. You're not expected to tip anyone at McDonald's. I'd be surprised if they're even allowed to take a tip in most restaurants."
McDonalds,"This is exactly what is happening. New cup, no charge refill. 

They can either have you go to the counter for your refill or they can leave the ""customer"" fountains turned on but staff it with a crew member to dispense drinks for you.

If a restaurant has a busy in-store lunchtime, they should be staffing it during that time.

All of this is just during pandemic. So expect it to last maybe a year or so. This isn't some big long-term policy thing; McDonald's is just doing their best to be sure they don't kill anyone."
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,No one likes them.
BurgerKing,"Look man, I know you enjoy my videos!"
BurgerKing,It's just rootbeer
BurgerKing,I would much rather have lunch for breakfast than breakfast for lunch.
BurgerKing,"It‚Äôs true, I worked at BK in high school and one time someone came up to me and said to me they are slightly upset our fries are cold. Being I worked the fry station, I took this great insult personally and I immediately saw red. I grabbed my flamethrower out of the car and burnt the whole restaurant down. My rampage continued as I decimated every fast food establishment in the area. The CEO of BK was walking by and saw all this going on, but it was too late. The restaurant was a pile of ashes and I was already fleeing the country to Colombia. The FBI intercepted me and brought me back, where the CEO personally fired me.

He was a dick, I have no idea why I was fired."
BurgerKing,Exactly why did you go in then?
McDonalds,and yet no ones answered the question why the UK menu is so limited and so stingy in its portions? anyone know why
McDonalds,"That is incorrect. Refills are to be given with a brand new cup from the DT soda system (ABS). Fun fact, the beverage bar in lobby can remain open, but only as a new position for a crew person that has a plastic barrier"
McDonalds,You guys are getting public soda fountains?
McDonalds,"Classic case of ""well yes, but actually no."" There is a soda fountain, but it's automated and tied into the drivethtu POS system, and while you can manually enter drinks, it drastically impacts the drivethtu times to do so."
McDonalds,If I'm eating at home I'm literally just gonna get a drink at my house lol
BurgerKing,Its the best
BurgerKing,"No it was discontinued pre COVID. It seemed to go away in quick succession of the national launch of the Impossible Whopper. As a manager, the impossible patties and the grilled chicken patties are/were the most expensive product we had. Each impossible patty costs $2 and each grilled chicken breast was almost $3. So if we had to waste prepared product it put a punch in our food cost. Which is why I almost always put them on cook to order after a certain time. 

Anyway. My thoughts are that BK Corp has to make a decision as to save food cost and not have two expensive products. And they chose the impossible patty. Personally I miss our grilled chicken and prefer our old Morningstar veggie burger. I still have people ask for both. 

Now. That being said. I have noticed that there is a grill chicken patty and brioche bun in my computer inventory labeled as market test. It‚Äôs been there for a few months along with an impossible sausage patty for breakfast. 

Fingers crossed."
McDonalds,"Its been like that since march, if you ask for a refill they give you a new cup and fill it up for you behind the counter"
McDonalds,"I never drink them, value meals are a scam!"
McDonalds,Not sure what you are getting at. Article doesn‚Äôt say what I asked.
BurgerKing,It's ridiculous that so many simpletons are still in denial and rushing things. But that's why they are simpletons in the first place
BurgerKing,Tis what I've suspected all along

McDonalds,All the Mcdonald‚Äôs with a drive thru and dining room will most definitely have two soda machines but I doubt it will be permanent as they‚Äòbe already purchased two separate items that they will want to continue utilizing at a later date
BurgerKing,Just stop.
McDonalds,It‚Äôs not permanent. It‚Äôs just a measure during the pandemic
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Like why? Social Distancing is Not forever.
BurgerKing,Exactly
BurgerKing,Ha thanks
BurgerKing,That sounds really good
McDonalds,"I bet not.

!remindme 1 year"
McDonalds,A good suggestion is to always read an article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,A good suggestion for the future is to read the article before commenting on it.
McDonalds,The headline is extremely misleading. It‚Äôs a temporary measure while dining rooms reopen at limited capacities. It is an operational strain to have employees filling drinks and refills for inside customers. It‚Äôs not a scheme to charge for refills. Fountain drinks are extremely profitable.
McDonalds,Does this mean I'm now expected to tip the associates that do the sodas for me? Like a real restaurant? Because if 15 year old Emilia gives so much as a sneer towards me then Mcdonalds won't ever see me tip anyone in its properties again for the rest of my life.
BurgerKing,Why profiteering of course!
McDonalds,Doesn't any location with a drive thru already have a soda fountain behind the counter?
McDonalds,"I wish we would just keep them closed, at least for a few more months"
McDonalds,"I highly doubt this is a permanent thing; where are stores going to cram a soda fountain behind the counter? Also, good luck getting the franchisees to pay for this. It is a costly venture to install a soda fountain."
McDonalds,"Oh no, its turning into Australia"
McDonalds,Thanks K
McDonalds,You are getting a new cup.
McDonalds,Never let a good crisis go to waste
BurgerKing,I wonder when I‚Äôll return to my BKs. I can‚Äôt wait. But I will wait. Looking at the stats for covid it feels too soon to reopen things. It really feels like a second wave of mass hospitalizations will happen. No one knows for sure what will happen. That‚Äôs enough doubt to keep me away.
BurgerKing,"Congrats. My store is opening next Monday. 25% capacity. No trays no refills. Getting my plexiglass installed this week. They aren‚Äôt even allowing self serve soda or ICEE. 

I‚Äôll be glad to not have my drive thru beeping non stop from open to close. Even through all this COVID stuff we are 10% higher sales from last year. 

I just got off a double and a ‚Äúclopen‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. 

Enjoy your meal. Miss seeing your posts."
BurgerKing,Cant wait for a double whopper cheese and bacon extra pickes.its been 3 months and still no news of opening(uk) üò≠
McDonalds,[deleted]
McDonalds,No great loss. I‚Äôve seen some that look like they haven‚Äôt been cleaned in a week or more. Nasty.
McDonalds,"This is ridiculous. Unless McDonald‚Äôs is going to give every customer a new cup every refill this will introduce a whole bunch of germs behind the counter. Having to touch the used cups. But then that makes me think like was said below they may now charge for refills, but during the lunch rush I‚Äôm not going to wait in line for a refill. I‚Äôll just cross McDonald‚Äôs off my list of places to go."
BurgerKing,I'm in NY and can confirm this is true. Had the same issue just 10 minutes ago. Started googling it and this thread popped up
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,That's how you make the SuperSize come back.....
McDonalds,And they will charge for refills I bet.
BurgerKing,"Thank you guys! I was thinking I was only one! The crowns and the fingers were amazing. Like you I'd give anything just to have one more meal from there while they were still in their prime. 

They were juicy and peppery and just the best. I can't imagine why they'd ""fix"" something that was far from broken."
BurgerKing,I too misst the classic tenders. They had too much black pepper in them just like I like. Way better than the current nuggets or chicken fries.
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,"I work at a BK and as far as I know they‚Äôve been discontinued temporarily and will be back eventually. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been telling us and we‚Äôve been telling customers for the last several months. Apparently they‚Äôre improving it or something similar? I guess it takes over half a year to improve a piece a chicken.

Maybe it‚Äôs just my store or maybe it‚Äôs gone for good idk."
BurgerKing,"I remember back in like 2005 the nuggets used to taste like the chicken fries and were AMAZING!! then around 2012-2013 I tried them again and I was so disappointed that the recipe changed. The old nuggets used to also be in different shapes, one that I remember distinctly was the crown shape. I‚Äôd kill to have those nuggets again. Anyone else remember?"

McDonalds,This started last week.
McDonalds,I think they already have $1 Large fry Fridays.
McDonalds,Sir this is the McDonald‚Äôs subreddit healthy eating isn‚Äôt the main topic here
BurgerKing,I'm from Canada and I never heard of that drink before. Is it similar to Dr. Pepper?
BurgerKing,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers but right around the time they had the French fry burger , they also had the value pork rib sandwich I would eat so many of them .  The chicken burgers also aren‚Äôt that bad with pickles and onions . Neither were the fiery chicken fries i didn‚Äôt like the buffalo or jalape√±o ones .Ah I miss working there
At times lol ."
BurgerKing,"I prefer birch beer but it's difficult to find. Royal Castle featured it during the '70s. Then Wendy's had it during the '90s and early '00s.

Dr. Pepper is close enough though"

BurgerKing,"his face pumping his managers gasket. He starts choking and his eyes grow blood shot.  His manager says ""what was that you little slut?""

""Will you hurry and cum?""

""I'll cum when I want to cum you little whore""

McDonalds,Lol - I just love the fries but trying to not be fat...
McDonalds,Wow I didn‚Äôt know people from r/choosingbeggars were real I thought everything on there was made up
McDonalds,"Meh - 800 calories of fat/carbs, just what I need.  Drop the prices on something healthy.  I need protein!"
McDonalds,They should promote it with TGIFFFF: Thank Goodness It's Free French Fries Friday
McDonalds,Ha. Two people doing this.
BurgerKing,"I don't miss any of those. I do miss the Yumbo and also the original Hot Apple Pie, the rectangular version in a box. They were so great for a quarter when I was a young kid. McDonald's came out with a copy but the crust was not nearly as substantial or tasty or even as golden brown. 

Arby's is the one that got rid of all the best stuff on their menu. I never go to Arby's anymore after they abandoned the Arby-Q and the Junior Roast Beef."
BurgerKing,"My local Burger King is an absolute mess. They only have one window open, even though they have two lanes. The first window just has boxes stacked up in front of it, no payment equipment. There‚Äôs multiple people in the window alcove, none wearing a mask. The man grabs my card, with the same gloved hand he‚Äôs grabbed everyone else‚Äôs card, and then hands me my card back and my food and drink. It was absolutely disgusting and yes, my state is still shut down due to Covid. We have plenty of cases and deaths in my zip code alone."
BurgerKing,Dr. Pepper is the best soda (imo)
McDonalds,He's actually probably talking about TravellingMcDs
BurgerKing,I miss to sourdough kings
McDonalds,"I think we did have a much stricter lockdown, but fast food restaurants made their own decisions to shut down. Delivery, takeaway and drivethru was always allowed but many places had chose not to. 

There might have been other reasons such as supplier issues, that‚Äôs just a theory, but no, they weren‚Äôt required to shut down because of the lockdown."
McDonalds,"The UK has a COVID-19 death rate of 518 per million, whereas the US is 270 per million.

*As of the 17th of May, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/* 

(re: u/mwmwmwmwmmdw ) However, McDonalds UK closed down everything on their own accord to the surprise of the government, who said they can stay open for delivery, drivethru and even takeaway."

BurgerKing,"&gt; My first day was last night. It went well

That's the part I don't believe"
McDonalds,"It is honestly one of my favorite things about traveling. Also, I loved it when McDonald‚Äôs in the states ran that (or maybe it is still going on) ‚Äúworldwide favorites‚Äù campaign, where they had that McFlurry from the Netherlands, the Burger from Spain, the Chicken Sandwich from Canada and the Cheesy Bacon fries from Australia. I think the Burger was probably my favorite."
McDonalds,"There was a guy who did a lot of business travel, mostly in Asia, and used to have a blog just about everything he found a different McD's around the world."
McDonalds,Amazing! I love going to McDonald‚Äôs in other countries and checking out the local menu. I can recall having a ‚Äúburrito‚Äù (like dinner style burrito) in Austria and also seeing multiple types of chicken sandwiches in Moldova that we can‚Äôt get in the US. And in Turkey they serve Ayran (a kind of yogurt/milk drink) with their food. Got to love the Golden Arches!

BurgerKing,"When I was in high school my best friend worked at a grocery store. We knew a guy who was a little on the not so bright side. My friend and I would regale him with outlandish stories that supposedly happened to us at our respective jobs. 

‚ÄúThis motherfucker started a fight with me at the checkout lane. I tossed his bag on the ground, I lunged at him. My boss bet me that I couldn‚Äôt kick his ass. I wore him down then grabbed a produce bag and put it over his face until that piece of shit stopped breathing.‚Äù 

This here is the kind of stupid shit that sound like."

BurgerKing,Yup! Though I actually got my copies from a 99c store ha I guess BK had a good amount of overstock.
BurgerKing,The screen image alone meant I would never watch one second. Obviously just another ranting simpleton
McDonalds,"This is all very much McDonald‚Äôs stuff and entirely consistent with the company culture. 

I‚Äôve been with corporate IT for over a decade and our restaurant facing communication and procedures guides are always like this. Very cheerleadery."
BurgerKing,"
Basically when you use the coupon lookup button you are not actually looking up a coupon. You are looking up a PLU. Every item in the register has a PLU. PLU 1000 is for ham. So it rings up ham etc. 

31300 rings up a rodeo cheeseburger. 3031300 ring up a rodeo cheeseburger Small combo. 
99.99 is a place holder price meaning the price was never entered and is not intended for sale

Just be careful, everything item entered is tracked by the POS. You dont want to get in trouble. In fact if you play around and find some of the probably mispriced coupons and get into trouble, not my fault."
McDonalds,"The scripted ""we're all in this together"" comments the employees are directed to say.  We already see this all over the television.  And also the ""thumbs up"" the employees are directed to sign.  It all sounds like propaganda to me - and I'm sure to other people who believe this lockdown has political motives."
McDonalds,"Distancing, avoiding open customer contact with common food supplies (in McD's case, this is closing self-pour beverage bars), shields, and so forth are all perfectly reasonable precautions from a scientific perspective.

What's your objection? 

ETA: This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm sincerely interested why you think this is ""government propaganda"" and, if this isn't what you're referring to, what ""government propaganda"" you're referring to."
BurgerKing,I could only stand to watch 10 seconds. You suck.

McDonalds,"Sorry, what are you talking about?

ETA...

If you have problems with other people wearing masks, I don't know what to tell you except that it's good science - but it doesn't really protect the people wearing them as much as it protects others from the people wearing them.

If you don't believe in science, I suggest you go live in a hut in the woods and eat what you can grow and catch. Science created modern life (for better and for worse.)"
BurgerKing,Garbage. So obnoxious
BurgerKing,Your channel

McDonalds,"I spent 15 minutes calling 5 different places in Georgia to try to figure out how to report them, before giving up. I actually wasn't all that concerned about the lack of masks as no restaurants use them and if the state tried to enforce it, they would just spend all their time going from restaurant to restaurant telling them to wear masks. But I wanted to see how hard it was to report a non-compliant business. Apparently, really hard.

I also used the McDonald's customer feedback form to report the franchise, but my form response only told me about all the wonderful sanitary procedures that were in place but weren't actually being followed. 

But again, I wasn't overly concerned. If I was really concerned I would've tweeted someone as that seems the best way to get corporate attention these days."
McDonalds,Is the guide available online?
McDonalds,Customers in SoCal call the police if you aren't wearing your mask.
McDonalds,"It's a lot of work to expect low-wage workers to adhere to. At my local McDonald's, the workers don't even wear face coverings even though it's required. I can't see them enforcing all these rules. Masks are rough to wear for a full day's work."
BurgerKing,Just when you come through the drive through to pick it up let the cashier at the speaker know. I have people do this all the time with sodas bc the app doesn‚Äôt have our full selection of coke bc we have freestyle. So I have people changing their drinks all the time. Adding spicy sauce to a whopper real quick SHOULDNT be a problem.
McDonalds,I always order my drinks with no ice
BurgerKing,I like that. Never realized that the 8 nugs were cheaper per nug. 12.5 cents vs 15 cents
BurgerKing,"Hyped to hear if it lets you. 
And yeah, I usually only order using the app, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no option to add the spicy sauce to whoppers. :("
BurgerKing,"ü§î
I might would allow that if I wasn‚Äôt too busy. Now I have to see if the Point of Sale will let me sub a tortilla for the bun. Firecracker sauce is bomb on whoppers in place of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Boomer?
McDonalds,I need a copy.
McDonalds,the first 58 pages are pictures of Ronald McDonald posing in different swim wear.
McDonalds,"In addition to several webinars, and an inspection from corporate before opening the lobby. 

It‚Äôs going to be a lot more complex than anyone around here (where I am located) expected."
McDonalds,Now it is so small it time to drop the Big.
BurgerKing,"I still don't acknowledge that fast food joints serve breakfast. I have never ordered it and can't imagine ordering it. It should be wall to wall Whoppers. 

BTW, what the heck is going on with drive thru ordering? Burger King never makes mistakes with my order. I can think of only one prior example over the decades. But it happened twice this week. Last night I specifically said two regular Whoppers. When I got home one of them was a double Whopper with cheese. I despise cheese on burgers. Thankfully a relative took it. Earlier in the week they screwed up the number of fries and type of drink.

I realize the drive thru is overworked but this is ridiculous. It feels like Wendy's putting cheese on anything even if you beg them not to, or Jack in the Box drive thru absolutely pot luck toward what you order and what you actually receive."
BurgerKing,I know right. I bet it would be good with the spicy sauce from the spicy chicken jrs.
BurgerKing,Write a cute note and put it on top of the money  make it romantic and put your # if she calls or texts there u go If she doesn‚Äôt then she just isn‚Äôt interested
BurgerKing,"Yeah, probably tbh. If you ask the manager if you can get the whopper put into a burrito wrap instead of a normal bun"
McDonalds,"[Check out this one in Innsbruck, Austria](https://imgur.com/a/Fzlb32w)"
BurgerKing,I've had their breakfast but it never occurred to me that they serve burgers that early.
BurgerKing,"There's a free 4pc nugget coupon with any purchase on the app. Order a 8 piece for a dollar and get the 4pc for free. You'll get 12 nuggets and 2 sauces for $1. Stop complaining.
You're eating fast food. You're the cheap bastard, not Burger King."
BurgerKing,God this looks so good
BurgerKing,"I like McDonalds breakfast, but BK is about 30 seconds away, and it‚Äôs just so much more convenient to go to bk."
BurgerKing,I prefer BK's burgers and McDonalds's breakfasts so it works out fine for me. I can imagine it sucks for people who prefer Mcdonald's burgers and BK's breakfast.
BurgerKing,"I wish BK did the opposite, all day breakfast."
BurgerKing,Aww yea nothing like a Whopper and fries after a wake and bake.
McDonalds,There is one like that in sydney
McDonalds,Looks like the UK had a much stricter lockdown than the US.  I feel for all of you across the pond.
BurgerKing,"I just had my first two days and later today is my 3rd day on the job! The first day I had the three hour orientation and then the second day I showed up and was shown around the kitchen before they put me on headset for the drive through. I was then put on take out orders at the front register, before the manager put me on watching BK link videos like others have mentioned. I think it really depends on what needs to be done in your store, but good luck on the new job!"

McDonalds,"I saw the one with a convert belt delivery service yesterday, where‚Äôs that one at?"
McDonalds,why did the UK stop drive thrus when they have been open no problem in north america through the pandemic
BurgerKing,"What the guy above mentioned is called the BK Link. It's an online course which covers the basic rules and standards of the company. It's a bit annoying but there are some parts that are really important and once you grasp them you'll be using them even outside of Burger King.

This will also explain the 12 criticals, care and last which are important but not mandatory for someone in the crew position (unless you're planning on growing with the company).

Good luck on your first shift. Remember that one of the most important things is communication so that everyone including yourself know what's happening and what's next."
BurgerKing,All my local BKs haven‚Äôt had onion rings since April :(
McDonalds,"From the posting rules in this sub's sidebar:

BurgerKing,I'm in CT and the store here said they're discontinued.  I'm soooooo sad.  :(
BurgerKing,"You should be doing videos for the first few days. If you have already done them depending on if you are a cook or a cashier I would have you shadow a tenured employee for three or four shifts. Taking orders and getting used to the POS then expediting then maybe graduate you to a headset. If you are kitchen you should be on the board with a tenured cook learning sandwiches and fryers. But that‚Äôs how I train. I‚Äôm very hands on with my new staff and have particular people I pair them with. 
As a result I have very low attrition and everyone is in perfect sync. 

I haven‚Äôt had to hire anyone in a while because I‚Äôm fully staffed but I have a cook leaving for college in a few months. I‚Äôm sad. She‚Äôs been there since she was 16 and she‚Äôs grown a LOT. I‚Äôm so proud of her. I dunno. I‚Äôm a mom and it transfers so easily to my job because I love all my kids. 

Good luck honey! I hope you gain lots of good experience."
BurgerKing,We in this together man lol good luck let me know how it goes!
BurgerKing,"Same here, my first day is tomorrow at 4:30"
BurgerKing,Oküëç
BurgerKing,Yea I usually get my BK late at night and almost always the fries are old/stale and the burger looks reheated too.
BurgerKing,Oh yes you get started on the video part of your training. Basically videos on how to deal with certain situations and their rules etc
BurgerKing,Ok üëç! I have heard others mention  like watching a video or something do you have any idea what that could be?
BurgerKing,"So this might be the 3 hour orientation. They will show you around the kitchen, tell you the rules, sign papers etc. The basics"
BurgerKing,No I haven‚Äôt done anything but went in for the interview about a week ago.
BurgerKing,"Have you done the 3 hour orientation yet? What happened with me was they gave me a tour around the kitchen and filled out papers(3 hour orientation), and then they told me come back next week a few days, and during those days i followed someone around and they showed me everything kinda like training. After 2 weeks of that I was all ready to go! congrats on the job !"
BurgerKing,"I'm literally sorry you were screwed over at birth into being born into a lunatic ignorant backwards cult. The whole world is sorry for you people. It's sad. And just based on your behavior on Reddit alone I can tell you you're not doing anything Christlike or purely in your anger tantrums. I think you need to look at yourself man because by any standard your behavior is not admirable or correct, and I'm talking aboit how you insulted other people not just me. Get a clue man. It's really sad."
BurgerKing,"I'm sorry you had the experience and upbringing you've have, if you need a proper father figure in your life let me know. I wish you all the best."
BurgerKing,"You've literally in a crazy ignorant religious cult. I don't think we need to argue anymore,it's pointless. You're an idiot."
BurgerKing,"For wanting the 10 piece deal over 8 piece? Ok bud. lol, you're on a whole other level of troll that I haveto tip my cap to. Have a good one."
BurgerKing,"You're literally a dumb person. We both know I'm not the first or the last to point this out in your real life. With any sense of self awareness, you have had moments of realizing this yourself. Why are we arguing when we both know you're just a stupid idiot who often makes a fool of himself? It's happened your entire life and this is the thing. Not 1 person has agreed with you and all you do is argue and get more upset. It's frankly pathetic.  Get a clue man, move on and keep your stupidity to yourself and your doomed family. Good riddance. Clearly the devil has you lol."
BurgerKing,"I'm gald that happens in your world, by the sound of it how you act on the internet, it's the exact opposite of who you are in real life. A scared, little weak individual, that hasto act big and hard on the internet to compensate what you lack in real life."
BurgerKing,It was 10 for 1.50. 8 for $1 is a better deal.
BurgerKing,"I actually ordered the 8pc the other day, while also using a coupon for buy1get1 whopper. And they gave me two sauces of sweet and sour. They also gave me a BBQ sauce because I asked nicely. I guess I totally got screwed over as a consumer on that one. I'm totally crying about it on Reddit.

Just Fucking ask nicely and they will probably give you whatever you want. What sort of boring pathetic shitbird comes to Reddit to complain about a sauce packet so much when everyone replying is clearly telling you you're being an idiot. I feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with such a crybaby boomer shitbird in real life. I hope Mason grows up to be a better and smarter man than his father."
BurgerKing,"Totally fucked. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. Your life must suck.

Just be polite and kindly ask for how many sauce you want. Fucking boomer dumbass."
BurgerKing,"10 piece they included 2 sweet and sour packets. 8 piece, it's only 1 packet. You're getting screwed over. ""50 cents less"", no. BK is making over 20 cents more, OR they're making more money on other food options. The consumer regardless gets fucked."
BurgerKing,"You're screwed over? Wow. What a baby. I'm so sorry. Boo hoo. Talk about a snowflake, getting butthurt over 2 less nuggets but 50cents less. You're life must be a total shitbird tragedy."
BurgerKing,"Sorry but no. Obviously there is a financial incentive why they no longer offer the 10 piece, screwing over millions of people."
BurgerKing,"Keep your zesty sauce to yourself, freak."
BurgerKing,Just get 16 for $2 you whiney little bitch
BurgerKing,What a stupid thumbnail. Garbage.
BurgerKing,"Also 8 nugs for $1. Thats the better deal. In your case get two 8 nugs, your $1 fries coupon, spent 50 cents more and get 6 extra nugs."
BurgerKing,"But in this instance we were specifically talking about the chicken fries, not what the best coupon was. And yes I have that coupon too. Personally I think the nugs and the chickfries basically taste the same just different texture/ratio per bite. Also i mainly just use the BOGO Whopper coupon."
BurgerKing,That's too broad and serves no productive analytical purpose.
BurgerKing,Better deal to get a 10 pc regular nuggets for $1.49 and use the $1 large fry coupon in the app. More food for 50 cents less.
BurgerKing,"In my area we get coupons in the mail like twice a month, one of them is large Chicken Fries and Large (regular) Fries for $3. Winner"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,You just can't use more than one coupon or mobile offer at a time.
BurgerKing,"If you rely on being obnoxious to be interesting, you really just look sad and pathetic as a human. This shit is garbage."
BurgerKing,"I can't tell if you're the most charming troll ever, or a complete idiot. Either way you've won me over."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,Try the chicken fries next time they are popular with your kind.
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,"Sorry I didn't know you were autistic. Try the chicken fries, lots of incels/autismo like those too."
BurgerKing,[deleted]
BurgerKing,I think you need to keep a diary or something
BurgerKing,"Ugh. How utterly pointless, not impressive, and stupid. Also terrible name. Anyone who identifies as ""your man/your boi"" gets an automatic cringe point in my book. Jesus this is stupid. 

Also two 4pc nuggets cost more than ordering one 8pc."
BurgerKing,Hopefully your card isn't charged until the order is confirmed in-store as completed and served. That's how it is for most places with mobile ordering. It sucks your order didn't go through but I don't think you'd be charged in the end.
BurgerKing,not lmao. More like what a pity
BurgerKing,"You're the worst sort of manager. You don't even make an effort to type a coherent comment, I can't imagine all you slack at in your store."
BurgerKing,"Just got onion rings in Illinois and was told by a friend in MI that they don't have them, googled it to see if he was bullshitting and apparently he's not. You can get onion rings 270 miles west if you'd like!"
BurgerKing,YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
BurgerKing, Yes Please!!!!!!!!
BurgerKing,I Like the Tacos! Better than Jack in the Box's Tacos.
BurgerKing,I have asked for onion rings at BK twice now and was told finally they will probably not return.  I loved them with the spicy sauce!  Why are they being discontinued?
McDonalds,"Remind them that ice melts into water and they'll immediately realise where they went wrong, water is clearly wet"
McDonalds,"At our Mcdonalds, we‚Äôre only giving out free medium coffees to front line workers, and we are given a $2 pay raise as well as free meals on shift and half off when we‚Äôre not working"
McDonalds,Or maybe just try offering the McVegan burger from Finland here in the US?
BurgerKing,Look at you ratting
McDonalds,"Already covered.

McDonalds,Wonder if she is on reddit.
BurgerKing,"its ok. my location was also very understaffed so it was difficult at times, i would mostly work in the kitchen nd usually there would be at least one other person in there with me but sometimes i‚Äôd be the only one nd it‚Äôd be soo stressful. my coworkers were chill but a lot of them were so incompetent, nd my managers were good for the most part. i did consider quitting like every other week tho lol"
BurgerKing,First there are many types of masks. Second most of them can block particles to different levels. It‚Äôs common sense. If you think that does nothing and prefer people coughing or sneezing on your face directly then go for it..
McDonalds,no but your attitude is.
McDonalds,Is my gold cringe-y too? Nanana na Nana!

BurgerKing,"I get a 2 rodeo burgers every week almost it‚Äôs my favorite burger..... literally for the past 12 years I love them soo much. I got one last week but this week when my boyfriend went out to buy me one for lunch they said they didn‚Äôt have any. I told him I had the issue before when people didn‚Äôt know what they were or how to make them, so the following day I called and they said their manufacturer changed and that they weren‚Äôt getting onion rings anymore and that it is most likely a permanent problem. I called 3 other burger kings all with the same story. I‚Äôm soo sad and idk what I will do with my rodeo burgers. ( lets be real it‚Äôs the best thing bk has)"
McDonalds,our quarter pounder pattys are fresh beef tho. so we might run into the same problem. our 10:1 meat for cheeseburgers etc is frozen so we should be allright.
BurgerKing,"Yeah. Pretty much. Although people do still try to order a 4pc for $1.29 and the 10pc for some dumb reason. 
Kinda like the people who insist on getting whopper jr ‚Äúplain‚Äù ($2.43)
When literally it‚Äôs the same patty and bun as a hamburger for $.99. 

‚ÄúBut I want a Whopper JUNIOR not a hamburger!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm just trying to save you money. A jr hamburger is the same patty and bun and is $.99‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want a HAMBURGER I want a Whopper JUNIOR!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, one whopper jr plain. Anything else today? $2.65 at the window!‚Äù

üôÑ"
BurgerKing,"&gt; $1 8pc promo. $1.49 for a 10pc.

so, you're saying get (2) 8pc..."
McDonalds,We accept walk-up orders.
BurgerKing,I do remember having these and they were pretty good! Coming the day before my birthday!
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôve always been a baby about spicy food. Literally swore off my husbands mashed potatoes ( that I‚Äôd been eating just fine for years ) when he let it slip he put tobasco sauce in them. 
But working with predominately Hispanic cooks I‚Äôve learned to adore spicy food. My favorite thing is a a spicy chicken sandwich with heavy mayo cheese bacon and BBQ sauce. I add firecracker sauce to most of my sandwiches and dip my nuggets in it too. So so good. 
I‚Äôm stoked for spicy nuggets this time around.
FYI impossible whopper is killer with firecracker sauce instead of ketchup."
BurgerKing,Everytime they come back my kiddo swears she can take the heat and everytime i have to back thru drive thru to get regulars ü•µü§£
McDonalds,even more cringe
BurgerKing,just please and also bring back them Cheeto chicken fries
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,Angry Whopper for sure. I still have people ask me. Whopperito was before my time.
BurgerKing,"I‚Äôm drooling thinking of it, I‚Äôll just have to ask for mine fresh. I also wish they‚Äôd bring back the whopperito and the angry whopper."
BurgerKing,"I haven‚Äôt broken into the cases to see if they changed the breading or anything. The last time we had them they didn‚Äôt seem to hold very well so I always cooked them in smaller amounts and would only hold them for 30min vs 60min. 
I‚Äôll cook some up this weekend to see. I‚Äôm so excited."
BurgerKing,These are the only decent nugs at BK. I was very sad when they went away. Glad they‚Äôre coming back üòà
BurgerKing,Yes please!!! I've been craving them for so long
McDonalds,You mis-spelled AWESOME!!
McDonalds,Cringe
BurgerKing,"Just spent 3 hours fielding almost 200 cars for lunch rush. Just two of us until 1pm when my other cashier got here. Finally able to do a deposit and rush to the bank. I‚Äôm exhausted. Here till 6pm today. Closing tomorrow at midnight then back at 9a on Sunday! Phew. 
For comparison. My usual daily car count is about 345 for the WHOLE day."
BurgerKing,I‚Äôm a Burger King employee and this same thing is happening at my store lately. Usually we get it to show up within a few minutes. I hope you get your money refunded!
McDonalds,[removed]
BurgerKing,+1
BurgerKing,I fucking hate it. No training they expect you to know how to do things by yourself. Don‚Äôt get the job. They treat you like a subhuman
BurgerKing,Hehe BK sends me two giant sheets of coupons every month.
BurgerKing,You can‚Äôt fake this. Taking ownership of the restaurant and treating it as a vehicle to propel both you and your employees forward. I loved reading this. Keep on trucking. ;)
McDonalds,"&gt;hot

Why the downvotes, so people not want to accept it?"
McDonalds,Agreed ‚Äî I wonder if we could ask for them to put one less pump of syrup in?
McDonalds,Also McDonald's has contingency lines because their supply is worldwide. They can bring in Australian meat into US supply like they did with US fries to Australian shores.
BurgerKing,"Started working 2 days before I turned 18. Currently going on 7 years. It's been really back and forth honestly. I am forever grateful for the store owners despite some negative aspects. They can be hard but have helped me out so much and pushed me to become a better worker and more productive. I generally like working here as I have some awesome coworkers and it's worth it financially for me.

I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few years ago. The free food is nice, I'll never go hungry. The customers push me over the edge sometimes though. As someone who has social anxiety it can be hard to deal with them. I've had numerous confrontations that have happened that kinda ruin my whole day. I still look back at some of them and my blood boils.

At this moment in time I really hate working simply due to the whole pandemic and the increase in business, it's completely ridiculous. Our drive through is running a nonstop rush from lunch until 9 or even 10pm at night."
BurgerKing,"I love my job! Unlike other managers I'm actually listening to my employees and care for them. I have noticed that it is a on going problem within the chain that managers act like a**holes. 
I think the worst part of the job are the customers, rude arrogant and believes they are better then you just because you are serving them. 
Only thing that makes me stay are my friend employees, and of course the food!"
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McD is the big dog and if you can‚Äôt keep them supplied you lose that massive account forever. Their suppliers will short every other customer before they short the clown.
McDonalds,"Actually McDs uses fresh beef for its quarter pounders now.

What would be a great number to see would be total Wendy's burger usage versus only McDs quarter pounder usage."
McDonalds,I wish the slushes were just a little less sweet.
BurgerKing,üôèüèª
BurgerKing,My store completely ignores the timers and at night nobody makes anything so you get stale food lmao
BurgerKing,"Honestly it's alright, I feel like my managers are fair, they help me out at drive thru when it's just me and they bag items too. I am pretty close with the people I work with and I enjoy it. The only thing I would like is free food or paid breaks"
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,Its only good with extra sauce imo
BurgerKing,"We ain‚Äôt fightin bro üòÇ

Damn that‚Äôs rough tho if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just going off what I know from my restaurant/area. As far as I know at my store they‚Äôre just gone temporarily."
BurgerKing,"Idk bro, I don't want to fight you 1) because I don't fight strangers on the internet 2) I don't know for sure and 3) I hope I'm wrong 

That said, directly from an employee I've been told they're 86 for life

ALSO well before corona, I would always get so mad you couldn't order rings on doordash, you couldn't pick it as a side for a combo, and they weren't listed as a side, but when you went to the restaurant they had them."
McDonalds,[removed]
McDonalds,It‚Äôs because McDs uses frozen beef and their suppliers can store it much longer. Wendy‚Äôs uses fresh beef.
BurgerKing,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that, she would even go out there when we were slammed"
BurgerKing,"I started when i was 17 and became a Assistant manager worst decision i ever made my boss was honestly and sexist asshole who only really gave a shit when the other boss were coming in. I used to work crazy shifts in high school like 2:30pm till 1 or 2 am (labor laws weren‚Äôt as strick) and when I graduated hs it went into over drive i worked over 80 hours for 1 week not all the time but enough that it was killing me mentally and physically. Eventually i just walked out in the middle of my shift now that im older i know that was wrong but at a certain point theres only so much you can take

Edit: definitely wasnt one of the managers to be in the office on my phone or something i never had time my GM did the schedule and he continuously understaffed us. So i did ever job from taking apart the broilers to going on the roof because the drains were clogged. Did the shipment order and multiple times put the shipment way because again my Gm didnt know how to make a schedule"
BurgerKing,There‚Äôs one girl I work with (not a manager) but she‚Äôll go outside and smoke every single time we don‚Äôt have a car in drive thru instead of helping restock or clean between orders.
BurgerKing,The amount of coupons people use are a reason to quit by themselves
BurgerKing,"You sound like the coworker I never had. My store does have a problem with managers sitting on their phones in the office pretending like they‚Äôre working or people going out to their cars to smoke weed for up to 30 minutes at a time and both gm and dm wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it because they were both pushovers. 

Another problem was the owner was too cheap to actually update anything in the store so our dryers and fryer filtering machine are all from the 70‚Äôs, the headsets weren‚Äôt even wireless and only 2 of the 7 actually worked. And Idk about the registers computers at other stores but the last time our software was updated was 2004 so our registers would freeze and crash on a weekly basis."
BurgerKing,Dont work there no more and wasn‚Äôt the Gm so i wasn‚Äôt wasting my time but to add to that all the burger kings in my area were like that and  they fired my Gm after i left and that store is this the same sooooo  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BurgerKing,"Wow that‚Äôs ridiculous, one of my shift supervisors would go on smoke breaks like every 30 minutes and stay out there for like 10 minutes"
BurgerKing,Omg is this Richmond?!
BurgerKing,Surprisingly no. However they did leave this one underage girl in charge of the store for hours at a time because the store manager hated being there so she dipped whenever she got the chance.
BurgerKing,"I was 16 when I worked at BK. It was fun, I ate everything for free. It was all fun and games until a customer ordered 30 original chickens. Or other gigantic orders lol"
